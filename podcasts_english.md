## üìªüéôÔ∏è Podcasts that I regularly listen to</h2>

I am a book person, but occasionally I listen to podcasts. Then these are my go to's:

- Podcasts in Norwegian
  - [Alternativ √∏konomi](https://alternativokonomi.no/)<br>
    This podcast delves into alternative economics, and how to organize our society differently. This is the podcast that introduced me to thinkers such as Julia Steinberger, and Jason Hickel. There are no new episodes after spring 2024.

  - [Energi og klima](https://www.energiogklima.no/podkast)<br>
    A podcast by the [Norwegian Climate Foundation](https://www.klimastiftelsen.no/). Their focus is on a society without man-made emissions of greenhouse gasses. Revolves mostly around Norway and the relationship with the EU with focus on the industry, the Green transition and of course what is going on when it comes to the phase out of fossile fuel production and consumption in Norway

  - [Verdib√∏rsen](https://radio.nrk.no/podkast/verdiboersen)<br>
    A podcast about philosophy from the Norwegian national broadcaster NRK. Is focused on philosophy, but quite often philosophy that is intervowen with the state of the world.

- Podcasts in English
  - [The Great Simplification](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/podcast)<br>
    This podcast is so much. If you go and have a look it says that it is a sensemaking platform. I agree. Nate Hagens, the founder has a phd in Ecological Economics and is very focused on how energy is much more important than almost everybody thinks. So a lot revolves around energy and the environment. But it is so much more, it delves into all sort of topics around the human predicament. You should listen to it just for all the extremely interesting topics, and the fantastic guests that are invited. If you want to know something about the background story, and what The great simplification is: watch this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xr9rIQxwj4)
