<h2>🗞️📺 In the Media (In Norwegian)</h2>
<p>After recognising the damaging effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, I have been an active voice advocating for the phase-out of fossil energy production in Norway. This has led to some media coverage:</p>

<h2>🕸️ Networks</h2>
<p>Summer of 2025 I signed up as a volunteer during the international conference for ecological economy and degrowth <a href="https://isee-degrowth2025.no/">ISEE-Degrowth 2025</a>. That was a very nice experience. I have never met so many people that have similar thoughts to myself. After that I signed up for the Norwegian network for degrowth <a href="https://vekstfri.no/">Vekstfri Norge</a></p>
<h2>📋 Learning more</h2>
<p>After I quit the oil industry I have wanted to work for change. I have therefore taken several courses.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.bi.no/studier-og-kurs/kurs/masterprogram/gronn-vekst-og-konkurransekraft/">Green growth and competitive advantage</a> This is a course led by <a href="https://www.stoknes.com/">Per Espen Stoknes</a> that you can take at <a href="https://www.bi.no/en/">the Norwegian Business school</a>. The course is about sustainable transition. I took the course autumn 2024 to spring 2025. It gave an overview both of the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis, and the needed transistion. I had read a lot from before, but especially the insight into sustainability reporting and carbon emission trading markets was very useful. As a part of the course I also wrote a thesis on <strong>Initiatives for transition of the Norwegian Industry</strong>. I learnt a lot. I had to look into Norwegian public inquiries and about both current and future EU regulations on this issue. Some of the topics I looked into were the European emission market, the coming carbon border tax, the demand for Carbon capture and storage projects, how the industry is trying to get rid of coal in the industrial processes, and much, much more.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/life-cycle-assessment">LCA analyse fra University of Michigan</a>. This course is a web-based course that you can take trough Coursera. I took it autumn of 2024, while I took took the course at BI (Norwegian Business school, see above), it was a nice supplement to the course I took there. It goes through all parts of life cycle analysis. Life cycle analysis is an analytical method that sheds light on the impact that a product has from when it is made to it is discarded (Cradle to grave). I learnt a lot.</p>
