## Profile

### Profile A: Sustainability and Systems Thinking  
Sustainability analyst with a solid scientific and digital background, combining domain expertise in numerical modelling with growing skills in life cycle assessment (LCA), ecological economics, green transition and systems thinking. Interested in linking decision-making under uncertainty to ecological and social realities. Currently deepening my knowledge of ESRS, CSRD and systems-based sustainability frameworks.

### Profile B: Digital Subsurface Specialist Turned Developer  
Geologist and backend developer with over 15 years’ experience in Python, including work with machine learning, Azure, Kubernetes and CI/CD. Passionate about agile thinking to create scalable and maintainable solutions. Former specialist in reservoir and uncertainty modelling. Combines digital craftsmanship with deep domain knowledge of workflows in the energy sector.

### Communicator with passion for nature with industry Insight 
Ex-oil worker aware of the predicament of all beings on this planet with a strong commitment to conveying the relevance of science to sustainability and society. Experienced in guiding others through complexity using systems thinking and storytelling.

## Context

Following a long career in the energy industry as a geologist, modeller and developer, I have shifted my focus to sustainability, transition and education. In my spare time, I have explored the many challenges facing humanity – a warming climate, ecosystem decline, species extinction, migration, and increasing political tension. After speaking out clearly about what I now regard as the fossil industry’s failure to face reality, I resigned from my position. I am driven by a strong desire to contribute positively rather than worsen the situation we are in. I am especially interested in how we can integrate ecological constraints and ethical considerations into digital tools, governance frameworks and educational practice. I want to help build a society that both understands and manages uncertainty in a changing world.

## 🗞️📺 In the Media (Norwegian)

After recognising the damaging effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, I have been an active voice advocating for the phase-out of fossil energy production in Norway. This has led to some media coverage:
- [Klassekampen 2021](https://klassekampen.no/artikkel/2021-08-19/vil-avvikle-sin-egen-bransje)  
- [Aftenbladet 2023](https://www.aftenbladet.no/meninger/debatt/i/ve1dQm/strategivalg-under-heteboelger)  
- [e24 2024](https://e24.no/energi-og-klima/i/JbnoWX/equinor-ansatt-fronter-oljeaksjon-bekymret-for-barna-mine)  
- [Klassekampen 2024](https://klassekampen.no/artikkel/2024-09-05/debatt-a-unnga-en-storulykke)  
- [Aftenbladet 2024](https://www.aftenbladet.no/meninger/debatt/i/OoyO11/klimaaksjoner-blind-lojalitet-hvor-man-bare-gjentar-alt-arbeidsgiveren-sier-har-lite-med-lojalitet-aa-gjoere)
