<h2>🛢️Oil and gas fields I have been working with</h2>
<p>I have worked with various fields oil and gas fields across the world. Each and everyone of the fields in this list have their own special challenges. Most of them are of course located in Norway. That is where I have had my workplace. At least for most of my career.
The reservoirs have been both ordinary sandstones, quartsites, and carbonates. What type of rock makes a big difference to how difficult it is to get the oil, or gas out of the ground. I have also worked with heavy oil, which means that the oil can be thick as treacle or tar. That also makes it a lot more difficult.</p>
