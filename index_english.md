I am a person who has many interests. I am fond of outdoor activities, especially when I can be in nature, passionate about music, love my wife and kids to bits, worry about the state of the world, have a really nerdy, strange love for programming, and much more. My strongest interest these days is what some people call the metacrisis, and others refer to as the human predicament. I have been diving into this topic for more than ten years now, and I just canâ€™t stop. There is always more to learn. I learn more about it from reading books, listening to podcasts, and discussing it with other people. It has led me to look into topics in philosophy, psychology, sociology, alternative economics, and climate science. One aim of this webpage is to share some of the <a href="people_english.md">people</a>, <a href="books_english.md">books</a>, and <a href="podcasts_english.md">podcasts</a> that have inspired me. Go have a look. If you want to know something more about my background you can have a look at <a href="cv_english.md"> my cv</a>.
