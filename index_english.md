Welcome to this website! I hope you find it interesting. I have made it mostly to tell about the journey I have been on the last couple of years.
I know there are quite a few people that have the same thoughts as me, and want to share my story. Maybe you become curious about these thoughts? Or, if you share mye view allready, become inspired to share your own thoughts with others?

Below is a picture of me, **Daniel Berge Sollien**, I have worked my entire work career in the oil industry, but have now quit, for reasons of conscience. If you move around on these pages you will find a bit about the journey I have had. But first a bit about who I am:

I am a person who has many interests. I am fond of outdoor activities, especially when I can be in nature, passionate about music, love my wife and kids to bits, worry about the state of the world, have a really nerdy, strange love for programming, and much more. My strongest interest these days is what some people call the metacrisis, and others refer to as the human predicament. I have been diving into this topic for more than ten years now, and I just canâ€™t stop. There is always more to learn. I learn more about it from reading books, listening to podcasts, and discussing it with other people. It has led me to look into topics in philosophy, psychology, sociology, alternative economics, and climate science.

The last couple of years I have become so concerned that I have tried to get involved somehow. I have also participated in the public debate. I believe that we are heading in the wrong direction, in several ways. If you are curious about how I have involved myself you can have a look <a href="involvement.md">here</a>

One aim of this webpage is to share some of the <a href="people_english.md">people</a>, <a href="books_english.md">books</a>, and <a href="podcasts_english.md">podcasts</a> that have inspired me. Go have a look.

If you want to know something more about my background you can have a look at <a href="cv_english.md"> my cv</a>.
