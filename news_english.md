I try to keep updated on news as much as I can. These are the sites that I keep coming back to.

## 🗞️ Newspapers I have subscriptions to

Editor-controlled newspapers are important in my opinion. Therefore I subscribe to several, which I of course read regularly too. Regarding the Guardian I don't have a subscription, but support them with a small sum of money monthly.

- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/europe)
- [Klassekampen](https://klassekampen.no/)
- [Morgenbladet](https://www.morgenbladet.no/)
- [Aftenbladet](https://www.aftenbladet.no/)

## 🆕 Newsletters

In addition to newspapers I subscribe to some newsletters. These are all free.

- [Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/)
- [We don't have time](https://www.wedonthavetime.org/our-community)
- [Inside climate news](https://insideclimatenews.org/)
